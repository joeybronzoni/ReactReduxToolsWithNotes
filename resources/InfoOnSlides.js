we don't need this activePost state object for this model. We can manually look at the posts
and send it to be rendered. So we have the bad-model, the good-model, but really we have one
more change and that is going to be our final model that we will work with:
 Here are the files: PostsProjectStore_Bad-Model.gif, PostsProjectStore_Good-Model.gif, ShowPage.gif,FinalGoodModel.gif

So what we are saying is that maybe it makes more sense to store our data inside an object
 rather than an array? ***This is an advanced refactor concept. But its how its done in
Production.
